# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Streamlit

![Project Image](character.png)

This interactive project is designed to help you understand how computers can recognize handwritten digits. You can draw a digit on a canvas, and the computer will try to recognize it using neural networks. This project provides an educational and fun way to explore the world of deep learning and machine learning.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pillow (PIL)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/): For image processing.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): For creating the interactive web application.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): For deep learning and neural networks.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): For machine learning operations, such as train-test splitting and calculating accuracy.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): For numerical operations.
- [OpenCV (opencv-python)](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/): For image processing.
- [scikit-learn wrapper for PyTorch (skorch)](https://skorch.readthedocs.io/): For integrating PyTorch with scikit-learn.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): For data visualization.
